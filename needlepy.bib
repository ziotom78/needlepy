@article{2008MarinucciNeedletsAndCMB,
    abstract = {We discuss spherical needlets and their properties. Needlets are a form of spherical wavelets which do not rely on any kind of tangent plane approximation and enjoy good localization properties in both pixel and harmonic space; moreover needlet coefficients are asymptotically uncorrelated at any fixed angular distance, which makes their use in statistical procedures very promising. In view of these properties, we believe needlets may turn out to be especially useful in the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data on the incomplete sky, as well as of other cosmological observations. As a final advantage, we stress that the implementation of needlets is computationally very convenient and may rely completely on standard data analysis packages such as healpix.},

quadrupole and octopole. The alignment between these multipoles is studied by
using a symmetry based approach which assigns a principal eigenvector (PEV) or
an axis with each multipole. We determine the significance of alignment between
these multipoles by using the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) 5 and 7 year
map s and also the maps obtained by using the Internal Power Spectrum
Estimation (IPSE) procedure. The effect of foreground cleaning is studied in
detail within the framework of the IPSE method both analytically and
numerically. By using simulated CMBR data, we study how the PEVs of the pure
simulated CMB map differ from those of the final cleaned map. We find that, in
general, the shift in the PEVs is relatively small and in random directions.
Due to the random nature of the shift we conclude that it can only lead to
misalignment rather than alignment of multipoles. We also directly estimate the
significance of alignment by using simulated cleaned maps. We find that the
results in this case are identical to those obtained by simple analytic
estimate or by using simulated pure CMB maps.},

    abstract = {(Abridged) We present the angular power spectra derived from the 7-year maps
and discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be inferred from WMAP data
alone. The third acoustic peak in the TT spectrum is now well measured by WMAP.
In the context of a flat LambdaCDM model, this improvement allows us to place
tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data alone, and on the
epoch of matter-radiation equality, The temperature-polarization (TE) spectrum
is detected in the 7-year data with a significance of 20 sigma, compared to 13
sigma with the 5-year data. The low-l EE spectrum, a measure of the optical
depth due to reionization, is detected at 5.5 sigma significance when averaged
over l = 2-7. The BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves from
inflation, remains consistent with zero. The upper limit on tensor modes from
polarization data alone is a factor of 2 lower with the 7-year data than it was
using the 5-year data (Komatsu et al. 2010). We test the parameter recovery
process for bias and find that the scalar spectral index, ns, is biased high,
but only by 0.09 sigma, while the remaining parameters are biased by \&lt; 0.15
sigma. The improvement in the third peak measurement leads to tighter lower
limits from WMAP on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g.,
neutrinos) in the early universe: Neff \&gt; 2.7 (95\% CL). Also, using WMAP data
alone, the primordial helium mass fraction is found to be YHe = 0.28+0.14-0.15,
and with data from higher-resolution CMB experiments included, we now establish
the existence of pre-stellar helium at \&gt; 3 sigma (Komatsu et al. 2010).},

@article{2010AgudoAGNPolarimetry,
    abstract = {We present the results from the first large (>100 sources) 3.5 mm polarimetric survey of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This wavelength is favorable within the radio-millimeter range for measuring the intrinsic linearly polarized emission from AGNs, since in general it is only marginally affected by Faraday rotation of the electric vector position angle and depolarization. The  I ,  Q ,  U , and  V  Stokes parameter observations were performed with the XPOL polarimeter at the IRAM 30 m Telescope on different observing epochs from 2005 July (when most of the measurements were made) to 2009 October. Our sample consists of 145 flat-radio-spectrum AGNs with declination >–30° (J2000.0) and flux density  1 Jy at \~{}86 GHz, as measured at the IRAM 30 m Telescope from 1978 to 1994. This constraint on the radio spectrum causes our sample to be dominated by blazars, which allows us to conduct new statistical studies on this class of high-luminosity, relativistically beamed emitters. We detect linear and circular polarization (above minimum 3σ levels of \~{}1.5\% and \~{}0.3\%) for 76\% and 6\% of the sample, respectively. We find a clear excess in degree of linear polarization detected at 86 GHz with regard to that at 15 GHz by a factor of \~{}2. Over our entire source sample, the luminosity of the jets is anticorrelated with the degree of linear polarization. Consistent with previous findings claiming larger Doppler factors for brighter γ-ray blazars, quasars listed in our sample, and in the  Fermi  Large Area Telescope Bright Source Catalog (LBAS), show larger luminosities than non-LBAS ones, but our data do not allow us to confirm the same for BL Lac objects. We do not find a clear relation between the linear polarization angle and the jet structural position angle for any source class in our sample. We interpret this as the consequence of a markedly non-axisymmetric character of the 3 mm emitting region in the jets. We find that intrinsic circular polarization is the most likely mechanism for generation of the circular polarization detected in our observations. Our new data can be used to estimate the 3.5 mm AGN contribution to measurements of the linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background, such as those performed by the  Planck  satellite.},

@article{2000BaccigalupiNNAndICA,
    abstract = {We implement an independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm to separate signals of different origin in sky maps at several frequencies. Owing to its self-organizing capability, it works without prior assumptions on either the frequency dependence or the angular power spectrum of the various signals; rather, it learns directly from the input data how to identify the statistically independent components, on the assumption that all but, at most, one of the components have non-Gaussian distributions. We have applied the ICA algorithm to simulated patches of the sky at the four frequencies (30, 44, 70 and 100 GHz) used by the Low Frequency Instrument of the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. Simulations include the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the synchrotron and thermal dust emissions, and extragalactic radio sources. The effects of the angular response functions of the detectors and of instrumental noise have been ignored in this first exploratory study. The ICA algorithm reconstructs the spatial distribution of each component with rms errors of about 1 per cent for the CMB, and 10 per cent for the much weaker Galactic components. Radio sources are almost completely recovered down to a flux limit corresponding to 22430.703C3CMB, where 03C3CMB is the rms level of the CMB fluctuations. The signal recovered has equal quality on all scales larger than the pixel size. In addition, we show that for the strongest components (CMB and radio sources) the frequency scaling is recovered with per cent precision. Thus, algorithms of the type presented here appear to be very promising tools for component separation. On the other hand, we have been dealing here with a highly idealized situation. Work to include instrumental noise, the effect of different resolving powers at different frequencies and a more complete and realistic characterization of astrophysical foregrounds is in progress.},

@article{2010ScalzoSuperChandrasekharSN,
    abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2007if, an overluminous ( M V    = –20.4), red ( B  –  V  = 0.16 at  B -band maximum), slow-rising ( t   rise  = 24 days) type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in a very faint ( M g    = –14.10) host galaxy. A spectrum at 5 days past  B -band maximum light is a direct match to the super-Chandrasekhar-mass candidate SN Ia 2003fg, showing Si  II  and C  II  at \~{}9000 km s –1 . A high signal-to-noise co-addition of the SN spectral time series reveals no Na  I  D absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the host galaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the Lira relation for normal SNe Ia. The ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strong maximum in  I  band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing in near-maximum-light spectra. SN 2007if also displays a plateau in the Si  II  velocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for an overdense shell in the SN ejecta. We calculate the bolometric light curve of the SN and use it and the Si  II  velocity evolution to constrain the mass of the shell and the underlying SN ejecta, and demonstrate that SN 2007if is strongly inconsistent with a Chandrasekhar-mass scenario. Within the context of a "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, and assuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4 ± 0.2  M   , with 1.6 ± 0.1  M    of  56 Ni and with 0.3-0.5  M    in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. Our modeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a more efficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the low velocities typical of super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia.},

    abstract = {We present a data analysis pipeline for cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments, running from multifrequency maps to the power spectra. We focus mainly on component separation and, for the first time, we work out the covariance matrix accounting for errors associated with the separation itself. This allows us to propagate such errors and evaluate their contributions to the uncertainties on the final products. The pipeline is optimized for intermediate and small scales, but could be easily extended to lower multipoles. We exploit realistic simulations of the sky, tailored for the Planck mission. The component separation is achieved by exploiting the correlated component analysis in the harmonic domain, which we demonstrate to be superior to the real-space application. We present two techniques to estimate the uncertainties on the spectral parameters of the separated components. The component separation errors are then propagated by means of Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the corresponding contributions to uncertainties on the component maps and on the CMB power spectra. For the Planck polarization case they are found to be subdominant compared to noise.},

@article{2002MainoFastICA,
    abstract = {We present a new, fast, algorithm for the separation of astrophysical components superposed in maps of the sky. The algorithm, based on the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) technique, is aimed at recovering both the spatial pattern and the frequency scalings of the emissions from statistically independent astrophysical processes, present along the line-of-sight, from multi-frequency observations, without any a priori assumption on properties of the components to be separated, except that all of them, except possibly one, must have non-Gaussian distributions. The analysis starts from very simple toy-models of the sky emission in order to assess the quality of the reconstruction when inputs are well known and controlled. In particular, we study the dependence of the results of separation conducted on and off the Galactic plane independently, showing that optimal separation is achieved for sky regions where components are smoothly distributed. Then we consider simulated observations of the microwave sky with angular resolution and instrumental noise, supposed to be white and stationary, at the mean nominal levels for the Planck satellite. The angular response function is assumed to be identical at each frequency since this is, up to now, one of the Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) limitations. We consider several Planck observation channels containing the most important known diffuse signals: the cosmic microwave background (CMB), Galactic synchrotron, dust and free2013free emissions. A method for calibrating the reconstructed maps of each component at each frequency has been devised. The spatial patterns of all the components have been recovered on all scales probed by the instrument. In particular, the CMB angular power spectra is recovered at the per cent level up to 2113max22432000. Frequency scalings and normalization have been recovered with better than 1 per cent precision for all the components at frequencies and in sky regions where their signal-to-noise ratio 22731.5; the error increases at 223C10 per cent level for signal-to-noise ratios 22431. Runs have been performed on a Pentium III 600-MHz computer; although the computing time slightly depends on the number of channels and components to be recovered, FastICA typically took about 10 min for all-sky simulations with 3.5-arcmin pixel size. Although the quoted results have been obtained under a number of simplifying assumptions, we conclude that FastICA is an extremely promising technique for analysing the maps that will be obtained by the forthcoming high-resolution CMB experiments.},

times in the very early history of the Universe. They are expected to
leave signatures in the observed cosmic microwave background
anisotropies. We significantly improved our previous analysis [W. Zhao,
D. Baskaran, and L. P. Grishchuk, Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ1550-7998 79, 023002
(2009)10.1103/PhysRevD.79.023002] of the 5-year WMAP TT and TE data at
lower multipoles l. This more general analysis returned essentially
the same maximum likelihood result (unfortunately, surrounded by large
remaining uncertainties): The relic gravitational waves are present and
they are responsible for approximately 20\% of the temperature
quadrupole. We identify and discuss the reasons by which the
contribution of gravitational waves can be overlooked in a data
analysis. One of the reasons is a misleading reliance on data from very
high multipoles l and another a too narrow understanding of the
problem as the search for B modes of polarization, rather than the
detection of relic gravitational waves with the help of all correlation
functions. Our analysis of WMAP5 data has led to the identification of a
whole family of models characterized by relatively high values of the
likelihood function. Using the Fisher matrix formalism we formulated
forecasts for Planck mission in the context of this family of models. We
explore in detail various ``optimistic,''
``pessimistic,'' and ``dream case'' scenarios. We
show that in some circumstances the B-mode detection may be very
inconclusive, at the level of signal-to-noise ratio S/N=1.75, whereas a
smarter data analysis can reveal the same gravitational wave signal at
S/N=6.48. The final result is encouraging. Even under unfavorable
conditions in terms of instrumental noises and foregrounds, the relic
gravitational waves, if they are characterized by the maximum likelihood
parameters that we found from WMAP5 data, will be detected by Planck at
the level S/N=3.65.},

The mechanisms of PBH formation are discussed and observational constraints on the PBH spectrum, or effects of PBH evaporation, are shown to restrict a wide range of particle physics models, predicting an enhancement of the ultraviolet part of the spectrum of density perturbations, early dust-like stages, first order phase transitions and stages of superheavy metastable particle dominance in the early Universe. The mechanism of closed wall contraction can lead, in the inflationary Universe, to a new approach to galaxy formation, involving primordial clouds of massive BHs created around the intermediate mass or supermassive BH and playing the role of galactic seeds.},

    abstract = {We propose that dark matter is dominantly comprised of atomic bound states.  We build a simple model and map the parameter space that results in the early universe formation of hydrogen-like dark atoms.  We find that atomic dark matter has interesting implications for cosmology as well as direct detection: Weak-scale dark atoms can accommodate hyperfine splittings of order 100 keV, consistent with the inelastic dark matter interpretation of the DAMA data while naturally evading direct detection bounds. Moreover, protohalo formation can be suppressed below  M proto  \~{} 10 3 –10 6 M  for weak scale dark matter due to Ion-Radiation and Ion-Atom interactions in the dark sector.},

@article{2004deOliveiraMicrowaveForegroundX,
    abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) team has produced a foreground map that can account for most of the low-frequency Galactic microwave emission in the WMAP maps, tentatively interpreting it as synchrotron emission. Finkbeiner and collaborators have challenged these conclusions, arguing that the WMAP team's \&quot;synchrotron\&quot; template is in fact dominated not by synchrotron radiation but by some dust-related Galactic emission process, perhaps spinning dust grains, making dramatically different predictions for its behavior at lower frequencies. By cross-correlating this synchrotron template with 10 and 15 GHz cosmic microwave background observations, we find that its spectrum turns over in a manner consistent with spinning dust emission, falling about an order of magnitude below what the synchrotron interpretation would predict.},

@article{2009_LFI_Morgante_SCS,
    abstract = {Two continuous closed-cycle hydrogen Joule-Thomson (J-T) sorption coolers have been fabricated and assembled by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the European Space Agency (ESA) Planck mission. Each refrigerator has been designed to provide a total of [?] 1W of cooling power at two instrument interfaces: they directly cool the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) around 20K while providing a pre-cooling stage for a 4 K J-T mechanical refrigerator for the High Frequency Instrument (HFI). After sub-system level validation at JPL, the cryocoolers have been delivered to ESA in 2005. In this paper we present the results of the cryogenic qualification and test campaigns of the Nominal Unit on the flight model spacecraft performed at the CSL (Centre Spatial de Liege) facilities in 2008. Test results in terms of input power, cooling power, temperature, and temperature fluctuations over the flight allowable ranges for these interfaces are reported and analyzed with respect to mission requirements.},

@article{2008ShojaefardNumericalContactResistance,
    abstract = {For some manufacturing processes, the heat transfer between the components, the tools and the environment has an effect on tool-life and the accuracy of the formed component. Consequently, the measurement of Thermal Contact Resistance (TCR) is of increasing interest to researchers and industrial engineers participating in the manufacture of high-precision components. A new transient method and measurement apparatus are used in which the measurements are conducted on specimens, which are retained under pressure. An apparent advantage of this method is the ability to estimate the TCR under specifically controlled conditions. The other advantage is that no prior information is needed on the variation of the TCR, since the solution automatically determines the functional form over the domain specified. Therefore, in this research, a new method of determining TCR has been successfully used to measure the dependence of TCR on the pressure and the specimen texture.},

@article{2008FiebergContactResistance,
    abstract = {The temperature distribution in combustion engine components is highly influenced by thermal contact resistance. For the prediction and optimisation of the thermal behaviour of modern combustion engines knowledge about the contact heat transfer is crucial. Available correlations to predict the contact resistance are simplifications of the real geometric conditions and only tested for moderate pressures up to 7 MPa. Typical combustion engine applications include contact pressures up to 250 MPa. The experimental approach presented here to derive the thermal contact resistance in terms of contact heat transfer coefficients for high temperature and high pressure conditions is based on transient infrared temperature measurements. Two bodies initially at two different temperatures are brought in contact and the surface temperature histories are recorded with a high-speed infrared camera. The contact heat flux is calculated by solving the related inverse problem. From the contact heat flux and from the measured temperature jump at the interface the contact heat transfer coefficient is calculated. The inverse method used for the calculation of the heat flux is based on the analytical solution for a semi-infinite body and a step response to a Neumann boundary condition. This method provides an algorithm that is used in a sequential manner. The use of  ” future” temperature data greatly improve the stability of the governing equations and reduce the sensitivity to measurement errors.},
