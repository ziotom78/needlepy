README for NeedlePy
===================

Introduction
------------
NeedlePy is a Python library using http://numpy.scipy.org/[NumPy] to implement
a fast needlet transform. It has been written by Maurizio Tomasi using a
http://www.literateprogramming.com/[literate programming] approach and the
http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/[Noweb tool].

License
-------
NeedlePy is released under a liberal BSD license (the same license used by
http://numpy.scipy.org/[NumPy] and http://www.scipy.org/[SciPy]). See the file
`LICENSE` for the full license.

Supported platforms
-------------------

NeedlePy has been developed on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6, but it can be run also
on Linux (and probably any other Unix machine). I am happy to implement patches
that allow the library to be used on other systems as well.

Installation
------------
You have to create the `needlepy.py` file from the Noweb sources in order to
use the library. This can be done by running `make` (or `gmake`, depending on
your platform). Once you have created the file, copy it in any of the
directories referenced by your environment variable `PYTHONPATH`.
